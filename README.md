Power electronics project (hardware only) to design and develop a maximum power point tracking buck convertor to efficiently power a model car from a solar panel. The model car was used to race other students. Complete documentation of the project can be seen in final_report.pdf. A photo of the prototyped buck converter can be seen below.
